            <h2>2. Object</h2>

            <p>&emsp;CryptoStudio hereby engages Referral Partner to provide marketing services in respect of CryptoStudio
                Services - as authorized for marketing by CryptoStudio from time to time - in the Territory.</p>

            <p>&emsp;CryptoStudio will provide Referral Partner access to a unique Referral Link designed to record each of
                Referral Partner's Introduced Merchants. In the event of the unauthorized use of such Referral Link,
                cookie stuffing or anything else that generates illegitimate referral credit, CryptoStudio reserves the right
                to immediately cancel the Referral Link, and discontinue making revenue share payments to Referral
                Partner, without notice to Referral Partner. In all other circumstances,</p>
            <p>&emsp;CryptoStudio may discontinue the Referral Link, and the campaigns associated with the distribution of
                the Referral Link, for any reason at any time by providing notice to Referral Partner. For this sole
                purpose, notice will be provided to Referral Partner via email. If cancellation of a Referral Link
                occurs, a new and/or different Referral Link may be provided to Referral Partner, at CryptoStudio's sole
                discretion. CryptoStudio and Referral Partner may review each campaign every ninety (90) days, or as needed,
                to determine the future continuation or cancelation of each campaign.</p>

            <h2>3. Client Approval</h2>

            <p>&emsp;All requests for Services from Clients introduced by Referral Partner shall be subject to
                acceptance by CryptoStudio. CryptoStudio shall not be bound by any terms offered by Refferal Partner to Client,
                and such terms shall be subject to final approval by CryptoStudio, which approval may be withheld at
                CryptoStudio’s sole discretion. Client applications and contract forms are in the name of CryptoStudio and will be
                provided by CryptoStudio for use by Referral Partner for the sole purpose of obtaining potential Clients for
                CryptoStudio.</p>
            <p>&emsp;CryptoStudio shall give Referral Partner a period of 1 month for each Client application to be fully
                submitted and approved by CryptoStudio. After the said period, Referral Partner loses exclusivity over
                Client, and CryptoStudio may accept Client directly or through other marketing providers, provided CryptoStudio
                makes all reasonable efforts to accept and approve each Client.</p>
            <p>&emsp;It is clarified that Client shall enter into a processing agreement with a processing company
                instructed by CryptoStudio.</p>

            <h2>4. Fees and payment terms</h2>

            <p>&emsp;4.1 CryptoStudio will pay the Referral Partner the fees as set out in Annex A of this Agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>&emsp;4.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, it is agreed and acknowledged by both parties, that if
                CryptoStudio suffers any loss on its activity with any Client, as a result of its services to and/or
                connection with such Client, then CryptoStudio may deduct amounts equal to such loss from any amounts due to
                Referral Partner at any time, whether as fees hereunder or otherwise.</p>
            <p>&emsp;4.3 Unless Referral Partner is in breach of its undertakings hereunder, it shall be entitled to the
                fees set forth above even after the termination of this Agreement for those Clients referred by it and
                accepted by CryptoStudio prior to the termination hereof, subject to CryptoStudio’'s deduction right as set forth
                in section 4.2 above and its other rights hereunder and under applicable laws.</p>
            <p>&emsp;4.4 CryptoStudio shall pay the corresponding fees on a monthly basis within 30 (thirty) days from the
                end of the month being invoiced for the transactions carried out by the relevant Client during said
                period.</p>

            <h2>5. Reporting</h2>

            <p>&emsp;CryptoStudio will supply Referral Partner with its Clients' processing activity reports through excel
                sheets or through an account created in CryptoStudio’s dashboard portal on a monthly basis.</p>
            <h2>6. Marketing costs</h2>

            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Referral Partner shall bear all its own marketing costs, although Referral
                Partner must:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 13px;">a) obtain CryptoStudio’s prior written approval for any marketing materials
                Referral Partner wishes to use in relation to CryptoStudio’s services;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 13px;">b) use any marketing materials that CryptoStudio may at its discretion provide for
                Provider’s use; and</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 13px;">c) ensure that the area(s) where CryptoStudio Services are marketed, and the staff
                appearing there, reflect CryptoStudio brand values as determined by the latter.</p>

            <h2>7. Term</h2>

            <p>&emsp;The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of its signature and shall continue for a
                period of one year after which it will be automatically extended for consecutive periods of one year
                each, unless either party terminates this Agreement at any time during its duration by giving not less
                than 30 days’ prior notice in writing to the other party.</p>
