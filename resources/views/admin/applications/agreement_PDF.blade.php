        <div style="page-break-before:always">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Variation of transaction types -</strong> There are multiple permissible e-commerce transactions
                that can be processed subject to
                the acquirer's availability of the specific solution (agreed upon prior to engagement). The merchant
                must seek approval
                from the solutions provider for use of any other payment option which had not been agreed upon prior in
                writing from the
                solutions provider (ie/ Alternative payment methods).</p>
            <p><strong>CNP (Card not present) transactions -</strong> Mail orders, Telephone orders, Internet
                transactions, and virtual terminals often
                constitute CNP transactions, these transactions are often undertaken where the physical card is not
                present during the
                point of sale, however, an instruction is sent to the account to debit the card holder's account.
                Merchants undertaking
                Internet transactions are required to comply with the terms of the agreement set out in this SLA.</p>

            <p><strong>Transaction Procedures -</strong> Merchant(s) abide by the terms that only transactions for sales
                are limited to that of its
                normal scope of business as indicated within the SLA.</p>

            <p>The processing of the merchant's/customers' transactions must be adherent to the rules and guidelines set
                out by the
                solutions provider. A unique set of rules are applicable for certain verticals of business as indicated
                below and within
                the SLA:</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> Prior to honoring a card payment, the merchant agrees to
                conduct verification that the card that has been
                used has not
                expired and that the CW2/CVC2 is present.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px;"> <strong>CNP and Internet transactions -</strong> processing of
                such transactions are subject to acceptance of the available currency, as
                agreed and outlined by the solution provider.</p>
            <p>Signed authorization/declaration (including order, application, and electronic transaction messages) must
                be obtained
                from the cardholder and kept on record for a period of a minimum of 12 months from the point when goods
                are out for
                delivery/received or the services to the cardholder have been rendered. It is paramount that a
                transaction receipt is
                sent to the cardholder electronically or in physical form (receipt). The merchant is under obligation to
                keep proof that
                the cardholder or the cardholder's agent had signed for and confirmed receipt of goods delivered to the
                outlined address
                upon confirmation of sale.</p>
            <p>Merchant(s) are not permitted to issue any type of cash refund to the cardholder in return for any
                services or
                merchandise purchased with the specific card. In such circumstances, the refund will only be made, by
                crediting the
                cardholder's account (subject to beneficiary banks' timescales). Transactions that have been previously
                processed are
                only the type of transaction that is eligible for "refund transactions".</p>

            <p> <strong>Settlements -</strong> The solutions provider acts as
                an intermediary between the merchant and the acquiring partner, settlements
                are subject to the merchant meeting and adhering to the criteria set out by the acquiring partner. The
                acquiring partner
                reserves the right to investigate and/or alter payment schedules as per the requirement, we are not the
                acquirer and
                simply connect the merchant to the acquiring partner.</p>

                <li>Merchants may encounter fees on settlements, such as processing fees, and service charges owed by
                    the beneficiary to the processor, or the issuing bank may deduct any monies owed by the processor
                    from amounts due to the merchant and the merchant will be notified of the applicable charges through
                    proper channels..</li>
                <li>In the event of refunds and chargebacks, the solutions provider will deduct the monetary amount of
                    the applicable
                    refund and/or chargeback, including any applicable fees from the settlement due to the merchant upon

            <p><strong> Security -</strong> The security of merchants, their customers, and the
                credibility of our acquiring partners is paramount.</p>
            <p>The merchant reserves the right to impose security requirements on cardholders to provide supporting
                documents/personal
                information as a conditional requirement to honor cards if such information is a requirement to provide
                the delivery of
                goods/services. The merchant reserves reason to believe the identity of the person using the card to
                make the relevant
                payment may be different from that of the cardholder.</p>
            <p>It is not permitted for the merchant or any party to disclose, sell or reveal data/information of the
                cardholder to any
                other person than the solution provider, the processor, or the applicable card association unless
                written authorization
                is provided by the cardholder or it is a requirement by the governing law to disclose to specific
                requestors.</p>
